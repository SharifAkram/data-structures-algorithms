/*
The important thing to note here is that the function ends as soon as we find
a pair that sums to 10. The best-case scenario, then, is when the first two
numbers add up to 10, since we can end the function before the loops even get
underway. An average-case scenario may be when the two numbers are somewhere in
the middle of the array. The worst-case scenarios are when there arenâ€™t any two
numbers that add up to 10, in which case we must exhaust both loops completely.
This worst-case scenario is O(N2), where N is the size of the array.
